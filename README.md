# Symetric Group Calculator
this angular application is a calculator that computes permutations in  $S_n$

## input 
The user can input the permutations as cycles using the following notation "(1,2,3)(7,2)" or declare matrecies 
inside of variables. This will be automaticaly converted into cycles. Inside the main Input the user can use 
variables using var(*variable name*) in connection with other cycles
## output
the result will be given as the resulting permutation matrix and as the coresponding shortened combination of permutations.
